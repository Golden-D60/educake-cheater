For all my fellow British kids, know that you will never have to do your Educake ever again with this :D

# NOTE: THIS IS VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT!
If you find any bugs or problems with using this extension, please open an issue!
# Usage
Download the code as a .ZIP file onto your computer and unzip the file.
On Chrome or Chrome-based browsers (e.g. Opera GX) go to your extension manager and enable developer mode, then click "Load Unpacked" and locate the folder of the ZIP file you just unzipped where the manifest.json file is inside and click "Select Folder". Now after installation go onto Educake and when you type in an answer it should say in bold under the question "The answer is...". If it doesn't, try reloading the page.
